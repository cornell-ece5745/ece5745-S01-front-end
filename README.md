ECE 5745 Section 1: ASIC Flow Front-End
==========================================================================

This repository contains the code and documentation for ECE 5745 Section
1 on the ASIC tool front-end. In this section, we will be discussing the
front-end of the ASIC toolflow. More detailed tutorials will be posted on
the public course website shortly, but this section will at least give
you a chance to edit some RTL and synthesize that to a gate-level
netlist.

You can find the actual section document in the repo here:
