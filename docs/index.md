Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this section, we will be discussing the front-end of the ASIC
toolflow. More detailed tutorials will be posted on the public course
website, but this section will at least give you a chance to edit some
RTL, synthesize that to a gate-level netlist, and then simulate that
gate-level netlist. The following diagram illustrates the tool flow we
will be using in ECE 5745. Notice that the Synopsys and Cadence ASIC
tools all require various views from the standard-cell library which part
of the ASIC design kit (ADK).

![](assets/fig/asic-flow-front-end.png)

The "front-end" of the flow is highlighted in red and refers to
the PyMTL simulator, Synopsys DC, and Synopsys VCS:

 1. We use the PyMTL framework to test, verify, and evaluate the
    execution time (in cycles) of our design. This part of the flow is
    very similar to the flow used in ECE 4750. Note that we can write our
    RTL models in either PyMTL or Verilog. Once we are sure our design is
    working correctly, we can then start to push the design through the
    flow. The ASIC flow requires Verilog RTL as an input, so we can use
    PyMTL's automatic translation tool to translate PyMTL RTL models into
    Verilog RTL.

 2. We use Synopsys Design Compiler (DC) to synthesize our design, which
    means to transform the Verilog RTL model into a Verilog gate-level
    netlist where all of the gates are selected from the standard-cell
    library. We need to provide Synopsys DC with abstract logical and
    timing views of the standard-cell library in `.db` format. In
    addition to the Verilog gate-level netlist, Synopsys DC can also
    generate a `.ddc` file which contains information about the
    gate-level netlist and timing, and this `.ddc` file can be inspected
    using Synopsys Design Vision (DV).

 2. We use Synopsys VCS for RTL and gate-level simulation. PyMTL uses
    two-state RTL simulation meaning every wire will be either a 0 (logic
    low) or 1 (logic high). Synopsys VCS uses four-state RTL simulation
    meaning every wire will be either a 0 (logic low), 1 (logic high), X
    (unknown), or Z (floating). Four-state RTL simulation can identify
    different kinds of bugs than two-state simulation such as bugs due to
    uninitialized state. Gate-level simulation involves simulating every
    standard-cell gate and helps verify that the Verilog gate-level
    netlist is functionally correct.

Extensive documentation is provided by Synopsys and Cadence. We have
organized this documentation and made it available to you on the [public
course webpage](http://www.csl.cornell.edu/courses/ece5745/syndocs). The
username/password is on Canvas.

The first step is to start access `ecelinux` using X2Go and then open a
terminal. Once you are at the `ecelinux` prompt, source the setup script,
clone this repository from GitHub, and define an environment variable to
keep track of the top directory for the project.

    % source setup-ece5745.sh
    % mkdir -p $HOME/ece5745
    % cd $HOME/ece5745
    % git clone https://github.com/cornell-ece5745/ece5745-S01-front-end
    % cd ece5745-S01-front-end
    % TOPDIR=$PWD

NanGate 45nm Standard-Cell Libraries
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

A standard-cell library is a collection of combinational and sequential
logic gates that adhere to a standardized set of logical, electrical, and
physical policies. For example, all standard cells are usually the same
height, include pins that align to a predetermined vertical and
horizontal grid, include power/ground rails and nwells in predetermined
locations, and support a predetermined number of drive strengths. In this
course, we will be using the a NanGate 45nm standard-cell library. It is
based on a "fake" 45nm technology. This means you cannot actually tapeout
a design using this standard cell library, but the technology is
representative enough to provide reasonable area, energy, and timing
estimates for teaching purposes. All of the files associated with this
standard cell library are located in the `$ECE5745_STDCELLS` directory.

Let's take a look at some layout for some cells.

    % klayout -l $ECE5745_STDCELLS/klayout.lyp $ECE5745_STDCELLS/stdcells.gds

Let's look at a 3-input NAND cell, find the NAND3_X1 cell in the
left-hand cell list, and then choose _Display > Show as New Top_ from the
menu. We will learn more about layout and how this layout corresponds to
a static CMOS circuit later in the course. The key point is that the
layout for the standard cells are the basic building blocks that we will
be using to create our ASIC chips.

The Synopsys and Cadence tools do not actually use this layout directly;
it is actually _too_ detailed. Instead these tools use abstract views of
the standard cells, which capture logical functionality, timing,
geometry, and power usage at a much higher level. Let's look at the
Verilog behavioral specification for the 3-input NAND cell.

    % less -p NAND3_X1 $ECE5745_STDCELLS/stdcells.v

Note that the Verilog implementation of the 3-input NAND cell looks
nothing like the Verilog we used in ECE 4750. This cell is implemented
using three Verilog primitive gates (i.e., two `and` gates and one `not`
gate), and it includes a `specify` block which is used for advanced
gate-level simulation with back-annotated delays.

Finally, let's look at an abstract view of the timing and power of the
3-input NAND cell suitable for use by the ASIC flow. This abstract view
is in the `.lib` file for the standard cell library.

    % less -p NAND3_X1 $ECE5745_STDCELLS/stdcells.lib

Now that we have looked at some of the views of the standard cell
library, we can now try using these views and the ASIC flow front-end to
synthesize RTL into a gate-level netlist.

PyMTL-Based Testing, Simulation, Translation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our goal in this section is to generate a gate-level netlist for
the following four-stage registered incrementer:

![](assets/fig/regincr-nstage.png)

We will take an incremental design approach. We will start by
implementing and testing a single registered incrementer, and then we
will write a generic multi-stage registered incrementer. For this section
(and indeed the entire course) your test harnesses, simulation drivers,
function-level models, and cycle-level models will all be written in
PyMTL. However, you are free to do your actual RTL design work in either
PyMTL or Verilog. Prof. Batten will now spend a few minutes explaining
how PyMTL works using these slides:

  - [https://www.csl.cornell.edu/courses/ece5745/handouts/ece5745-S01-front-end-slides.pdf](https://www.csl.cornell.edu/courses/ece5745/handouts/ece5745-S01-front-end-slides.pdf)

### Choose RTL Design Language

So the first step is to decide if you want to do this section using PyMTL
RTL or Verilog RTL. Edit these two files using `geany` or your favorite
text editor to let the framework know your choice:

    % geany $TOPDIR/sim/regincr/RegIncrRTL.py
    % geany $TOPDIR/sim/regincr/RegIncrNstageRTL.py

Set the `rtl_language` variable to `verilog` if you want to use Verilog
for your RTL design and set it to `pymtl` if you want to use PyMTL for
your RTL design. For example, this is what it would look like to use
`verilog`:

    rtl_language = 'verilog'

### Implement, Test, and Translate a Registered Incrementer

Now let's run all of the tests for the registered incrementer:

    % mkdir -p $TOPDIR/sim/build
    % cd $TOPDIR/sim/build
    % pytest ../regincr

The tests will fail because we need to finish the implementation. Let's
start by focusing on the basic registered incrementer module.

    % cd $TOPDIR/sim/build
    % pytest ../regincr/RegIncrRTL_test.py

Use `geany` or your favorite text editor to open the implementation and
uncomment the actual combinational logic for the increment operation. So
a PyMTL RTL implementation should look as follows:

    from pymtl3 import *

    class RegIncrPRTL( Component ):

      # Constructor

      def construct( s ):

        # Port-based interface

        s.in_ = InPort  ( Bits8 )
        s.out = OutPort ( Bits8 )

        # Sequential logic

        s.reg_out = Wire( 8 )

        @update_ff
        def block1():
          if s.reset:
            s.reg_out <<= 0
          else:
            s.reg_out <<= s.in_

        # Combinational logic

        s.temp_wire = Wire( 8 )

        @update
        def block2():
          s.temp_wire @= s.reg_out + 1

        # Combinational logic

        s.out //= s.temp_wire

      def line_trace( s ):
        return f"{s.in_} ({s.reg_out}) {s.out}"

A Verilog RTL implementation should look as follows:

    `ifndef REG_INCR_V
    `define REG_INCR_V

    module RegIncrVRTL
    (
      input  logic       clk,
      input  logic       reset,
      input  logic [7:0] in_,
      output logic [7:0] out
    );

      // Sequential logic

      logic [7:0] reg_out;

      always @( posedge clk ) begin
        if ( reset )
          reg_out <= 0;
        else
          reg_out <= in_;
      end

      // Combinational logic

      logic [7:0] temp_wire;

      always @(*) begin
        temp_wire = reg_out + 1;
      end

      // Combinational logic

      assign out = temp_wire;

    endmodule

    `endif /* REG_INCR_V */

If you have an error you can use a trace-back to get a more detailed
error message:

    % cd $TOPDIR/sim/build
    % pytest ../regincr/RegIncrRTL_test.py --tb=long

Once you have finished the implementation let's rerun the tests:

    % cd $TOPDIR/sim/build
    % pytest ../regincr/RegIncrRTL_test.py -sv

The `-v` command line option tells `pytest` to be more verbose in its
output and the `-s` command line option tells `pytest` to print out the
line tracing. Make sure you understand the line tracing output. You can
also dump VCD files for waveform debugging with `gtkwave`:

    % cd $TOPDIR/sim/build
    % pytest ../regincr/RegIncrRTL_test.py -sv --dump-vcd
    % gtkwave regincr.RegIncrRTL_test__test_small.vcd

If you are using Verilog RTL instead of PyMTL RTL, you need to use this:

    % cd $TOPDIR/sim/build
    % gtkwave regincr.RegIncrRTL_test__test_small_top.verilator1.vcd

PyMTL supports automatically translating PyMTL RTL into Verilog RTL so we
can then use that Verilog RTL with the ASIC flow. To test the translated
verilog RTL you can use the `--test-verilog` command line option:

    % cd $TOPDIR/sim/build
    % pytest ../regincr/RegIncrRTL_test.py --test-verilog
    % ls *.v
    % less RegIncrRTL__pickled.v

You should use `--test-verilog` regardless of whether or not you
implemented your design using PyMTL RTL or Verilog RTL. Take a look at
the generated Verilog RTL. If you did your design in Verilog RTL then it
won't generate any Verilog since we still have the Verilog RTL that you
wrote by hand. If you did your design in PyMTL RTL, hopefully it should
be clear the one-to-one mapping from PyMTL RTL to Verilog RTL.

### Implement, Test, and Translate Multi-Stage Registered Incrementer

Now let's work on composing a single registered incrementer into a
multi-stage registered incrementer. We will be using _static elaboration_
to make the multi-stage registered incrementer _generic_. In other words,
our design will be parameterized by the number of stages so we can easily
generate a pipeline with one stage, two stages, four stages, etc. Let's
start by running all of the tests for the multi-stage registered
incrementer.

    % cd $TOPDIR/sim/build
    % pytest ../regincr/RegIncrNstageRTL_test.py

Use geany or your favorite text editor to open the implementation and
uncomment the static elabroation logic to instantiate a pipeline of
registered incrementers. So a PyMTL RTL implementation should look as
follows:

    from pymtl3 import *
    from pymtl3.passes.backends.verilog import TranslationConfigs
    from .RegIncrRTL import RegIncrRTL

    class RegIncrNstagePRTL( Component ):

      # Constructor

      def construct( s, nstages=2 ):

        # Port-based interface

        s.in_ = InPort  ( Bits8 )
        s.out = OutPort ( Bits8 )

        # Instantiate the registered incrementers

        s.reg_incrs = [ RegIncrRTL() for _ in range(nstages) ]

        # Connect input port to first reg_incr in chain

        connect( s.in_, s.reg_incrs[0].in_ )

        # Connect reg_incr in chain

        for i in range( nstages - 1 ):
          connect( s.reg_incrs[i].out, s.reg_incrs[i+1].in_ )

        # Connect last reg_incr in chain to output port

        connect( s.reg_incrs[-1].out, s.out )

      # Line tracing

    def line_trace( s ):
      pipe_str = '|'.join([ str(reg_incr.out) for reg_incr in s.reg_incrs ])
      return f"{s.in_} ({pipe_str}) {s.out}"

So a Verilog RTL implementation should look as follows:

    `ifndef REG_INCR_NSTAGE_V
    `define REG_INCR_NSTAGE_V

    `include "regincr/RegIncrVRTL.v"

    module RegIncrNstageVRTL
    #(
      parameter nstages = 2
    )(
      input  logic       clk,
      input  logic       reset,
      input  logic [7:0] in_,
      output logic [7:0] out
    );

      // This defines an _array_ of signals. There are p_nstages+1 signals
      // and each signal is 8 bits wide. We will use this array of
      // signals to hold the output of each registered incrementer stage.

      logic [7:0] reg_incr_out [nstages+1];

      // Connect the input port of the module to the first signal in the
      // reg_incr_out signal array.

      assign reg_incr_out[0] = in_;

      // Instantiate the registered incrementers and make the connections
      // between them using a generate block.

      genvar i;
      generate
      for ( i = 0; i < nstages; i = i + 1 ) begin: gen

        RegIncrVRTL reg_incr
        (
          .clk   (clk),
          .reset (reset),
          .in_   (reg_incr_out[i]),
          .out   (reg_incr_out[i+1])
        );

      end
      endgenerate

      // Connect the last signal in the reg_incr_out signal array to the
      // output port of the module.

      assign out = reg_incr_out[nstages];

    endmodule

    `endif /* REG_INCR_NSTAGE_V */

Before re-running the tests, let's take a look at how we are doing the
testing in the corresponding test script. Use `geany` or your favorite
text editor to open up `RegIncrNstageRTL_test.py`. Notice how PyMTL
enables sophisticated testing for highly parameterized components. The
test script includes directed tests for two and three stage pipelines
with various small, large, and random values, and also includes random
testing with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 stages. Writing a similar test harness in
Verilog would likely require 10x more code and be significantly more
tedious!

Let's re-run a single test and use line tracing to see the data moving
through the pipeline:

    % cd $TOPDIR/sim/build
    % pytest ../regincr/RegIncrNstageRTL_test.py -sv -k 3stage_small

And now let's run all of the tests both without and with translation:

    % cd $TOPDIR/sim/build
    % pytest ../regincr/RegIncrNstageRTL_test.py -sv
    % pytest ../regincr/RegIncrNstageRTL_test.py --test-verilog
    % ls *.v
    % less RegIncr4stageRTL__pickled.v

Notice how we have generated a wrapper which picks a specific parameter
value for this instance of the multi-stage registered incrementer.

Finally, we are going to run all of the tests with the `--dump-vtb`
option which will generate a Verilog test-bench that can then be used for
RTL and gate-level simulation.

    % cd $TOPDIR/sim/build
    % pytest ../regincr/RegIncrNstageRTL_test.py --test-verilog --dump-vtb
    % ls *.v
    % less RegIncr4stageRTL_test_4stage_random_tb.v
    % less RegIncr4stageRTL_test_4stage_random_tb.v.cases

### Simulate Multi-Stage Registered Incrementer

Test scripts are great for verification, but when we want to push a
design through the flow we usually want to use a simulator to drive that
process. A simulator is meant for evaluting the area, energy, and
performance of a design as opposed to verification. We have included a
simple simulator called `regincr-sim` which takes a list of values on the
command line and sends these values through the pipeline. Let's see the
simulator in action:

    % cd $TOPDIR/sim/build
    % ../regincr/regincr-sim 0x10 0x20 0x30 0x40
    % less RegIncr4stageRTL__pickled.v

We now have the Verilog RTL that we want push through the next step in
the ASIC front-end flow.

Using Synopsys VCS for 4-State RTL Simulation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Recall that PyMTL3 simulation of PyMTL3 RTL or Verilog RTL uses two-state
simulation. To help catch bugs due to uninitialized state (and also just
to help verify the design using another Verilog simulator), we can use
Synopsys VCS for four-state RTL simulation. This simulator will make use
of the Verilog test-bench generated by the `--dump-vtb` option from
earlier (although we could also write our own Verilog test-bench from
scratch). Here is how to run VCS for RTL simulation:

    % mkdir -p $TOPDIR/asic/synopsys-vcs-rtl-sim
    % cd $TOPDIR/asic/synopsys-vcs-rtl-sim
    % vcs -full64 -sverilog +lint=all -xprop=tmerge -override_timescale=1ns/1ns \
        +incdir+../../sim/build \
        +vcs+dumpvars+vcs-rtl-sim.vcd \
        -top RegIncr4stageRTL_tb \
        ../../sim/build/RegIncr4stageRTL__pickled.v \
        ../../sim/build/RegIncr4stageRTL_test_4stage_random_tb.v

This is a pretty long command line! We will go over some of these options
in the discussion section. However, we also provide you a shell script
that has the command ready for you to use.

    % cd $TOPDIR/asic/synopsys-vcs-rtl-sim
    % source run.sh
    % ls

You should see a `simv` binary which is the compiled RTL simulator which
you can run like this:

    % cd $TOPDIR/asic/synopsys-vcs-rtl-sim
    % ./simv

It should pass the test. Now let's look at the resulting waveforms.

    % gtkwave vcs-rtl-sim.vcd

Browse the signal hierarchy and view the waveforms for one of the four
registered incrementers. Note how the signals are initialized to X and
only become 0 or 1 after a few cycles once we come out of reset. If we
improperly used an initialized value then we would see X-propagation
which would hopefully cause a failing test case.

Using Synopsys Design Compiler for Synthesis
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

We use Synopsys Design Compiler (DC) to synthesize Verilog RTL models
into a gate-level netlist where all of the gates are from the standard
cell library. So Synopsys DC will synthesize the Verilog + operator into
a specific arithmetic block at the gate-level. Based on various
constraints it may synthesize a ripple-carry adder, a carry-look-ahead
adder, or even more advanced parallel-prefix adders.

We start by creating a subdirectory for our work, and then launching
Synopsys DC.

    % mkdir -p $TOPDIR/asic/synopsys-dc-synth
    % cd $TOPDIR/asic/synopsys-dc-synth
    % dc_shell-xg-t

We need to set two variables before starting to work in Synopsys DC.
These variables tell Synopsys DC the location of the standard cell
library `.db` file which is just a binary version of the `.lib` file we
saw earlier.

       dc_shell> set_app_var target_library "$env(ECE5745_STDCELLS)/stdcells.db"
       dc_shell> set_app_var link_library   "* $env(ECE5745_STDCELLS)/stdcells.db"

We are now ready to read in the Verilog file which contains the top-level
design and all referenced modules. We do this with two commands. The
analyze command reads the Verilog RTL into an intermediate internal
representation. The elaborate command recursively resolves all of the
module references starting from the top-level module, and also infers
various registers and/or advanced data-path components.

    dc_shell> analyze -format sverilog ../../sim/build/RegIncr4stageRTL__pickled.v
    dc_shell> elaborate RegIncr4stageRTL

We can use the `check_design` command to make sure there are no obvious
errors in our Verilog RTL.

    dc_shell> check_design

It is _critical_ that you review all warnings. Often times there will be
something very wrong in your Verilog RTL which means any results from
using the ASIC tools is completely bogus. Synopsys DC will output a
warning, but Synopsys DC will usually just keep going, potentially
producing a completely incorrect gate-level model!

We now need to create a clock constraint to tell Synopsys DC what our
target cycle time is:

    dc_shell> create_clock clk -name ideal_clock1 -period 1

Finaly, the `compile` comamnd will do the actual logic synthesis:

    dc_shell> compile

We write the output to a Verilog gate-level netlist and a `.ddc` file
which we can use with Synopsys DV.

    dc_shell> write -format verilog -hierarchy -output post-synth.v
    dc_shell> write -format ddc     -hierarchy -output post-synth.ddc

We can also generate usful reports about area, energy, and timing. Prof.
Batten will spend some time explaining these reports:

    dc_shell> report_resources -nosplit -hierarchy
    dc_shell> report_timing -nosplit -transition_time -nets -attributes
    dc_shell> report_area -nosplit -hierarchy
    dc_shell> report_power -nosplit -hierarchy

Make some notes about what you find. Note the total cell area used in
this design. Finally, we go ahead and exit Synopsys DC.

    dc_shell> exit

Take a few minutes to examine the resulting Verilog gate-level netlist.
Notice that the module hierarchy is preserved.

    % less post-synth.v

Take a close look at the implementation of the incrementer. What kind of
standard cells has the synthesis tool chosen? What kind of adder
microarchitecture?

We can use the Synopsys Design Vision (DV) tool for browsing the
resulting gate-level netlist, plotting critical path histograms, and
generally analyzing our design. Start Synopsys DV and setup the
`target_library` and `link_library` variables as before.

    % design_vision-xg
    design_vision> set_app_var target_library "$env(ECE5745_STDCELLS)/stdcells.db"
    design_vision> set_app_var link_library   "* $env(ECE5745_STDCELLS)/stdcells.db"

You can use the following steps to open the `.ddc` file generated during
synthesis.

 - Choose _File > Read_ from the menu
 - Open the `post-synth.dcc` file

You can use the following steps to view the gate-level schematic for the
design.:

 - Select the `RegIncr4stageRTL` module in the _Logical Hierarchy_ panel
 - Choose _Schematic > New Schematic View_ from the menu
 - Double click the box representing the `RegIncr4stageRTL` in the schematic view
 - Continue to double click to move through the design hierarchy

You can determine the type of module or gate by selecting the module or
gate and choosing _Edit > Properties_ from the menu. Then look for
`ref_name`. You should be able to see the schematic for a single stage of
the pipline including the flip-flops and an `add` module. See if you can
figure out why the synthesis tool has inserted AND gates in front of each
flip-flop. If you look inside the `add` module you should be able to see
the adder microarchitecture.

You can use the following steps to view a histogram of path slack, and
also to open a gave-level schematic of just the critical path.

 - Choose _Timing > Path Slack_ from the menu
 - Click _OK_ in the pop-up window
 - Select the left-most bar in the histogram to see list of most critical paths
 - Right click first path (the critical path) and choose _Path Schematic_

Using Synopsys VCS for Fast-Functional Gate-Level Simulation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Good ASIC designers are always paranoid and _never_ trust their tools.
How do we know that the synthesized gate-level netlist is correct? One
way we can check is to rerun our test suite on the gate-level model. We
can do this using Synopsys VCS for fast-functional gatel-level
simulation. Fast-function refers to the fact that this simulation will
not take account any of the gate delays. All gates will take zero time
and all signals will still change on the rising clock edge just like in
RTL simulation. Here is how to run VCS for RTL simulation:

    % cd $TOPDIR/asic/synopsys-vcs-ffgl-sim
    % vcs -full64 -sverilog +lint=all -xprop=tmerge -override_timescale=1ns/1ns \
        +delay_mode_zero \
        +incdir+../../sim/build \
        +vcs+dumpvars+vcs-rtl-sim.vcd \
        -top RegIncr4stageRTL_tb \
        $ECE5745_STDCELLS/stdcells.v \

        ../../sim/build/RegIncr4stageRTL_test_4stage_random_tb.v

This is a pretty long command line! So we provide you a shell script that
has the command ready for you to use.

    % cd $TOPDIR/asic/synopsys-vcs-ffgl-sim
    % source run.sh

You should see a `simv` binary which is the compiled RTL simulator which
you can run like this:

    % cd $TOPDIR/asic/synopsys-vcs-rtl-sim
    % ./simv

It should pass the test. Now let's look at the resulting waveforms.

    % gtkwave vcs-rtl-sim.vcd

Browse the signal hierarchy and display all the waveforms for a subset of
the gate-level netlist using these steps:

 - Expand out the signal tree until you find an _add_ module
 - Right click on the _add_ module and choose _Recurse Import > Append_

Notice how we can see all of the single-bit signals corresponding to each
gate in the gate-level netlist, and how these signals all change on the
rising clock edge without any delays.

To-Do On Your Own
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have time, push the multi-stage registered incrementer through the
flow again, but this type use a faster clock constraint. This will force
the tools to be more agress as they attempt to "meet timing". Try using a
clock constraint of 0.3ns instead of 1ns. Use `report_resources` to
determine what kind of adder microarchitecture the synthesis tool has
chosen. Use `report_timing` to see if the tool is able to generate a
gate-level netlist that can really run at 333MHz. Use `report_area` to
compare the area of the design with the 0.3ns clock constraint to the
design with the 1ns clock constraint. Use Synopsys DV to visualize the
improved adder microarchitecture.
